The ``2-matrix_divided`` module
==========================

This module has one function only called ``matrix_divided()``.

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

    >>> matrix = [
        ["Hello", 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6]
        ]

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> print(matrix_divided)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> matrix = [
        ["1", 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6]
        ]

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

    >>> print(matrix_divided)
        [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
