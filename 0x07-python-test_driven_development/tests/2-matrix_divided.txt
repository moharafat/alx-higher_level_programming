The ``2-matrix_divided`` module
==========================

This module has one function only called ``matrix_divided()``.

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

    >>> matrix = [
    ... ["Hello", 2, 3],
    ... [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> print(matrix)
    [['Hello', 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

    >>> matrix = [
    ... ["1", 2, 3],
    ... [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

    >>> matrix = []

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> matrix = ""

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> matrix = ["HELLO AND HAPPY AFTERNOON"]

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
